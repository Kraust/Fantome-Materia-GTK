# Fantome-Materia-GTK
Fantome theme based on [addy-dclxvi/gtk-theme-collections](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/gtk-theme-collections) using a Material Design Dark color palette.

I wanted a GTK2/3 colorscheme to go with [NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) so I made one. I don't expect anyone else to find value in this unless you really like Openbox + GTK + nvim-qt.
